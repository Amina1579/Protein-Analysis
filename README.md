•	Domain Analysis: InterPro results identify a DRBM (Double-stranded RNA-binding motif) and several disordered regions. The presence of these domains suggests the protein interacts with nucleic acids or is part of a larger ribonucleoprotein complex.•	GC Content & Repeats: The sequence has a GC content of approximately 57%. High GC content is characteristic of stable coding regions and influences the thermal stability of the DNA structure.
